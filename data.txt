to be or not to be that is the question
all the worlds a stage and all the men and women merely players
brevity is the soul of wit
the lady doth protest too much methinks
now is the winter of our discontent
some are born great some achieve greatness
et tu brute
what light through yonder window breaks
friends romans countrymen lend me your ears
parting is such sweet sorrow
love looks not with the eyes but with the mind
the course of true love never did run smooth
if music be the food of love play on
uneasy lies the head that wears a crown
hell is empty and all the devils are here
there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so
cowards die many times before their deaths
the evil that men do lives after them
men at some time are masters of their fates
what is past is prologue
life is but a walking shadow a poor player
we are such stuff as dreams are made on
the fault dear brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves
our doubts are traitors and make us lose the good we oft might win
some rise by sin and some by virtue fall
this above all to thine own self be true
there are more things in heaven and earth horatio than are dreamt of in your philosophy
out damned spot out i say
good night good night parting is such sweet sorrow
what a piece of work is man how noble in reason how infinite in faculties
lord what fools these mortals be
better a witty fool than a foolish wit
all that glisters is not gold
fair is foul and foul is fair
though she be but little she is fierce
there is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood leads on to fortune
cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war
double double toil and trouble fire burn and cauldron bubble
beware the ides of march
o brave new world that has such people in it
my kingdom for a horse
once more unto the breach dear friends once more
all that lives must die passing through nature to eternity
the robbed that smiles steals something from the thief
strong reasons make strong actions
sweet are the uses of adversity
what seest thou else in the dark backward and abysm of time
words without thoughts never to heaven go
youths a stuff will not endure
